# Text-based Monopoly Again

## Description

Over a year ago, I made a text-only clone of Monopoly in Python. (Textopoly)  
After my fellow developer friend Patel (patelheet30) found out about it,  
seeing how horribly written it is, challenged me to rewrite it better.  
I felt that my Python skills have improved a lot since then, I accepted the challenge.  
Now that I've rewritten it, please rate it and suggest how I could improve it further!

## Running the Game

Python 3.10+ is required to run the game. (match case, union type operator)  
(Get Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/)

1. Download the zip file and extract it  
   (In releases "Source code (zip)" or with "Code" button)
2. Open ```cmd``` or ```Terminal``` and navigate to the project's src folder
   with ```cd```  
   (e.g. ```cd Donwloads/TextopolyAgain/src```)
3. Run the main.py file with the appropiate command:  
   Windows: ```python main.py```  
   Linux/macOS: ```python3 main.py```

## Game modification

These files can be edited to modify the game,  
They're located in the ```src/options``` folder:

- ```debug_cheats.py```: Debugging and cheats
- ```house_rules.py```: Common house rules

Replace their default values with True, False  
or with specified values in the comments below the options
