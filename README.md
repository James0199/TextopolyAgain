# Text-based Monopoly Again

### A Revision of my horribly written text-only monopoly clone in Python.

Note: Hotels don't exist in this version of the game  
(I don't know why they're in the board game anyway)

## Running the Game

Python 3.10+ is required to run the game.  
To run the game, download all files and run main.py

## Game modification

modules/debug_cheats.py was originally meant for debugging,  
but it can be modified to change some parts of the game.  
In the future, modules/house_rules.py will be added to make game modification easier.

## Fun Fact

Most people are missing the point of Monopoly
