# Text-based Monopoly Again

### A Revision of my horribly written text-only monopoly clone in Python.

Note: Hotels don't exist in this version of the game  
(I don't know why they're in the board game anyway)

## Running the Game

Python 3.10+ is required to run the game.

1. Download the zip file and extract it
2. Open ```cmd``` or terminal and navigate to the project's src folder with ```cd```  
   (e.g. ```cd Donwloads/TextopolyAgain/src```)
3. Run the main.py file with the appropiate command:  
   Windows: ```python main.py```  
   Linux/macOS: ```python3 main.py```

## Game modification

These files can be edited to modify the game,  
They're located in the ```src/options``` folder:  
```debug_cheats.py```: Debugging and cheats
```house_rules.py```: Common house rules

## Fun Fact

Most people are missing the point of Monopoly
